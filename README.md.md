## Project Background & Objectives
**Dataset source and context:** Challenge - 1 (https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge)

## Overview
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. This report gives Business Insights to regain their market share and revenue.

## Key Findings

 1. **Bangalore**

- This city has the lowest 'Room capacity' to 'Bookings' ratio and 'Bookings' to 'Checked out' ratio. This, despite the city ranking 2nd amongst 4 cities, in room capacity and revenue. Average room rating of Bangalore is the lowest of all 4 cities.

- Presidential rooms - Highest occupancy rate, Highest average room ratings, High cancellation rates. Even though Bangalore collects low Revenue from Presidential suite, the Revenue Per available Room (RevPaR) value of presidential suite is the highest of all 4 room categories. We can try reducing the price point of Presidential suites to see if there is an uptake in room bookings. 

- Premium categories  - Low cancellation, Low no show rate. The improvement in revenue Realisation % occured when Cancellation % reduced. Hence, understanding reason for cancellation will be a good place to improve revenue. 

- Standard rooms - Lowest cancellation rate, Highest revenue realisation rate, Highest no show rate. Hence, it seems like people are okay with losing the cost of room booking. If people currently pay a part of the room rent for booking, we can consider to increase the % of room rent paid for booking, to discourage no show. 

- Elite rooms - High cancellation, High no show rate, Lowest room rating, Low revenue realisation rate. Each of these quality indicators must be addressed since this accounts for 36.6% of all bookings.

- Yet, the Revenue from Hyderabad has been lesser than Bangalore. The average daily rates of all room is very low, compared to all other cities, and room categories. Hence RevPaR is also the lowest amongst all cities.  
36.78% of all its room booking is in elite rooms.

## Strategic Recommendations

 1. **Bangalore** 

 - Bangalore has to improve its total bookings, particularly improve in Elite, Premium and Standard room categories. The city also needs to improve its booking to successfully checked out %. It is the lowest amongst all cities. 

- Bangalore has the 2nd highest Average Daily Rate amongst 4 cities. Atliq Exotica and Atliq Palace, some of highest revenue properties, have low RevPaR in Bangalore. They also have the lowest room rating in Bangalore. The performance of both these Properties need to be improved to improve the overall business. 

 2. **Hyderabad** 

 - Hyderabad hasn’t done as well in Revenues as how it has performed in the quality indicators. Performance of AtliQ Exotica, AtliQ Palace and AtliQ Grands may be the reason why revenues are low. 

- The Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN) & Daily Utilised Room Nights (DURN) values reveal that booked and utilized rooms are far lesser in AtliQ Exotica, AtliQ Palace and AtliQ Grands, particularly in AtliQ Exotica.

- The Elite  Premium rooms can charge better room rent, and Presidential suites & high end properties need to identify the reason for low quality of service and improve them as soon as possible. 

 3. **Mumbai** 

 - The Revenue & Market share can be improved by simply improving Quality of service in select properties & Premium rooms.

 - Premium category of rooms alone need to improve the overall Quality of service and hence revenue realisation rate. 

 - There are particularly 4 properties which need to improve their quality of service, namely, AtliQ Seasons, AtliQ Bay, Atliq Grand and Atliq City. 

 4. **Delhi**

- Elite and Standard rooms have to improve their quality of service to improve Revenue. 

- AtliQ Bay and AtliQ City perform low in all quality indicators. They need to improve the quality of service to regain market share and hence revenue. 

- Delhi has capacity to overtake Bangalore in revenue, if only Delhi had more capacity, for the same quality and revenue performance metrics. Delhi can consider expanding capacity.
